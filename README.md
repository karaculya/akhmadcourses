# akhmad-courses

Akhmad-courses is my web design coursework written by me on bootstrap 5

I made a layout in Figma and I'm trying to repeat it with code

My coursework contains the following files:

file name            | file content
---------------------|----------------------
style.css            | styles that I did not find in bootstrap :p
login.html           | login page file
index.html           | home page file
personal-cabinet.html| personal account page file
course.html          | single available course page file
task.html            | the file of the page that hosts the assignment for this course
test.html            | the file of the page that hosts the test for this course
error.html           | error page file, you can go to it by clicking on an unavailable course on the main page or on a button that does not work :p

I need to write this work quickly
